            Names <strong>Danno</strong>, born January 6th 2014 in Vader Washington. He's a tan Chow Chow that we got for my dad for his 50th birthday. For his birthday, we went to Hawaii, when the morning of, I told him we got a puppy. His names Danno because my dad's favorite TV show is <em>Hawaii 5-0</em> (Suiting for 50th birthday). <strong>Obviously</strong>, we nammed him after a character on the show as we were in Hawaii for his 50th, so it was either Danno or Steve. So Danno it was.
          </p>
          <p>We run an <em>Instagram</em> account for him with <span style="color: gold;">1600 </span> followers at the moment.</p>
