            Names Danno, born January 6th 2014 in Vader Washington. He's a tan Chow Chow that we got for my dad for his 50th birthday. For his birthday, we went to Hawaii, when the morning of, I told him we got a puppy. His names Danno because my dad's favorite TV show is Hawaii 5-0 (Suiting for 50th birthday). Obviously, we nammed him after a character on the show as we were in Hawaii for his 50th, so it was either Danno or Steve. So Danno it was.
